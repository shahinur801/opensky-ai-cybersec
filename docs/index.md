# OpenSky AI Cybersecurity Documentation

## Overview

OpenSky AI Cybersecurity is a real-time aircraft tracking and security analysis system that leverages the OpenSky Network API to monitor aircraft movements and detect potential security threats.

## Features

- **Real-time Aircraft Tracking**: Monitor live aircraft positions using OpenSky Network data
- **Security Analysis**: AI-powered threat detection and anomaly identification
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Web-based interface for monitoring and analysis
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for data access and system integration
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and maps for better understanding of air traffic patterns

## Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: Integration ready for PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- **API Client**: OpenSky Network REST API
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow/PyTorch for threat detection algorithms

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: CSS3 with responsive design
- **Charts**: Chart.js for data visualization
- **Maps**: Integration ready for Leaflet/MapBox

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## API Endpoints

### Aircraft Data
- `GET /api/aircraft` - Get current aircraft data
- `GET /api/aircraft/{icao24}` - Get specific aircraft info
- `GET /api/threats` - Get detected security threats

### System Status
- `GET /api/health` - System health check
- `GET /api/stats` - System statistics

## Security Features

### Threat Detection
- Unusual flight patterns
